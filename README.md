# TrayIconBuster
Based on [this](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19620/LP-TrayIconBuster) code by Luc Pattyn. I have updated it to clean up zombie icons more thoroughly. Instead of removing the icon itself and leaving behind a blank space (as the old project does on my computer), this removes zombie icons without leaving a blank space in the tray.
